# Zendesk Attachment Downloader

Downloads attachments from Zendesk tickets through the user's authenticated Chrome session using `osascript` + Chrome JavaScript execution. This bypasses the Glean MCP limitation where attachment download URLs are not available.

## Prerequisites

### macOS Only

This skill uses `osascript` (AppleScript) to control Google Chrome. It only works on macOS.

### One-Time Setup

**Enable JavaScript from Apple Events in Chrome:**

Option A — Via menu (immediate, no restart):
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Menu bar → **View** → **Developer** → check **"Allow JavaScript from Apple Events"**

Option B — Via terminal (requires Chrome restart):
```bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleScriptEnabled -bool true
```
Then quit and reopen Chrome.

### Runtime Requirements

- **Google Chrome must be running**
- **At least one tab must be open on `datadog.zendesk.com`** (any page — ticket view, home, search — doesn't matter)
- The user must be logged into Zendesk in that Chrome session

## When This Skill is Activated

Triggers:
- "download attachments from ticket 1234567"
- "download flare from ZD-1234567"
- "list attachments on ticket #1234567"
- "get the agent flare from this ticket"
- "fetch ticket files"
- Called by `zendesk-ticket-investigator` during investigation

## AI Compliance Check (MANDATORY — FIRST STEP)

**Before processing ANY ticket data**, check for the `oai_opted_out` tag:

```bash
.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh ticket {TICKET_ID}
```

If the output contains `ai_optout:true`:
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** — do NOT process ticket data through the LLM
2. Do NOT download or analyze attachments (attachment content is customer data)
3. Tell the user: **"Ticket #{TICKET_ID}: AI processing is blocked — this customer has opted out of GenAI (oai_opted_out). Handle manually without AI."**
4. Exit the skill

This is a legal/compliance requirement. No exceptions.

## How to Use

Say: **"download attachments from ticket 1234567"**

The agent will:
1. Find the Zendesk tab in Chrome
2. **Run AI Compliance Check** (see above)
3. Call the Zendesk API to list all attachments on the ticket
4. Show you the list (name, size, type)
5. Download files via Chrome and move to `cases/ZD-{id}/assets/`
6. If an agent flare `.zip` is found, extract to `cases/ZD-{id}/assets/flare/` and offer analysis

## How It Works

1. `osascript` locates a Chrome tab on `zendesk.com`
2. Executes a synchronous `XMLHttpRequest` inside that tab to call `/api/v2/tickets/{id}/comments.json`
3. The request uses the browser's session cookies — no API token needed
4. Parses the response to extract attachment metadata (`file_name`, `content_url`, `size`, `content_type`)
5. Creates a temporary `<a download>` element in the DOM and clicks it to trigger Chrome's native download
6. Monitors `~/Downloads/` for the downloaded file

## Attachment Types Handled

| Type | Extension | Auto-Action |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Agent flare | `.zip` (contains `datadog-agent-*`) | Move to assets/, extract to assets/flare/, offer analysis |
| Log file | `.log`, `.txt` | Move to cases/ZD-{id}/assets/ |
| Screenshot | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | Move to cases/ZD-{id}/assets/ |
| Config file | `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.conf` | Move to cases/ZD-{id}/assets/ |
| HAR file | `.har` | Move to cases/ZD-{id}/assets/ |
| Other | any | Move to cases/ZD-{id}/assets/ |

## Integration with Other Skills

- **zendesk-ticket-investigator** — Calls this skill to download attachments during investigation. Files are saved to `cases/ZD-{id}/assets/` and findings go into `cases/ZD-{id}/notes.md`.

## Security Notes

- No API tokens are stored or needed — uses the existing Chrome session
- JavaScript execution requires explicit user opt-in (Allow JavaScript from Apple Events)
- Only accessible on `localhost` — no remote access
- The `content_url` from Zendesk includes a signed token, valid for the session
