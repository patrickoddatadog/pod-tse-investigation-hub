name: zendesk-ticket-pool
description: Check and display the current Zendesk ticket pool assigned to the user. Uses Chrome JS execution (real-time, no delay) as primary method, with Glean MCP as fallback. Use when the user asks about their ticket queue, open tickets, pending tickets, ticket pool, ticket status, workload, or wants to see what tickets need attention. This skill should be used proactively at the start of conversations when working in the TSE workspace.

# Zendesk Ticket Pool Checker

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with `osascript`
- **Google Chrome** running with a tab open on `zendesk.com`
- **"Allow JavaScript from Apple Events"** enabled in Chrome (View > Developer > Allow JavaScript from Apple Events) — one-time setup

## Instructions

### Step 1: Try Chrome JS (Real-Time)

Run BOTH searches in parallel:

```bash
.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh search "type:ticket assignee:me (status:new OR status:open)"
.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh search "type:ticket assignee:me status:pending"
```

Output per ticket: `id | status | priority | product | tier | complexity | replies | updated | subject`

If either returns `ERROR: No Zendesk tab found`, skip to Step 2.

**Optional — fetch a specific view/filter:**

If the user provides a view URL like `https://datadog.zendesk.com/agent/filters/{VIEW_ID}`:

```bash
TAB=$(.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh tab)
# Then use osascript to call /api/v2/views/{VIEW_ID}/execute.json
```

### Step 2: Glean Fallback

Use only if Chrome JS is unavailable.

First, resolve your name (try Chrome JS even if search failed — tab might exist but search timed out):
```bash
AGENT_NAME=$(.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh me | cut -d'|' -f2 | xargs)
```
If that also fails, use `AGENT_NAME` from `zd-api.sh me` output cached earlier, or ask the user.

**Search 1 - Open tickets:**
```
Tool: user-glean_ai-code-search
query: *
app: zendesk
dynamic_search_result_filters: assignee:{AGENT_NAME}|status:open
exhaustive: true
```

**Search 2 - Pending tickets:**
```
Tool: user-glean_ai-code-search
query: *
app: zendesk
dynamic_search_result_filters: assignee:{AGENT_NAME}|status:pending
exhaustive: true
```

**Note:** Glean data may be up to 30 minutes stale. Mention this in the output header.

### Step 2b: AI Compliance Check (MANDATORY)

For each ticket found, check for the `oai_opted_out` tag by running:

```bash
.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh ticket {TICKET_ID}
```

If the output contains `ai_optout:true`, mark that ticket as **AI BLOCKED** in the output table.
Do NOT trigger any follow-up AI skills (difficulty, ETA, investigator, etc.) for AI-blocked tickets.
This is a legal/compliance requirement. No exceptions.

### Step 3: Parse Ticket Data

From each result, extract:

| Field | Chrome JS Source | Glean Source |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Ticket ID | search output col 1 | URL path |
| Subject | search output last col | `title` |
| Status | search output col 2 | `matchingFilters.status[0]` |
| Priority | search output col 3 | `matchingFilters.priority[0]` |
| Product | search output col 4 | `matchingFilters.producttype[0]` |
| Tier | search output col 5 | `matchingFilters.tier` |
| Complexity | search output col 6 | N/A |
| Replies | search output col 7 | `matchingFilters.label` |
| Critical | search output col 8 (if CRIT) | `matchingFilters.critical[0]` |
| Updated | search output col 9 | `updateTime` |

### Follow-up Detection

A ticket is a **follow-up** when:
1. Subject starts with `Re:`
2. Content contains `follow-up to your previous request #XXXXXX`

When detected:
- Extract the **parent ticket ID**
- Mark with "Follow-up" indicator
- Link parent: `[#parentID](https://datadog.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/parentID)`

### Step 4: Present Results

#### Header

```
## Ticket Pool - [Date] [Time]

**Source:** Chrome JS (real-time) | OR | **Source:** Glean (may be up to 30min stale)

**New:** X | **Open:** Y | **Pending:** Z | **Total: X+Y+Z**
```

#### Table (sorted by priority desc, then last update)

| # | Ticket | Subject | Status | Priority | Customer | Product | Replies | Tier | Updated | Notes |
|---|--------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------|---------|------|---------|-------|

- Link ticket IDs: `[#ID](https://datadog.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/ID)`
- Truncate subjects to ~50 chars
- Show relative time for Updated (e.g. "2h ago", "1d ago")
- Flag critical tickets with an indicator
- Notes column: "Follow-up from [#parentID](link)" or "Critical" or "AI BLOCKED" or empty
- If a ticket has `ai_optout:true`, add **"AI BLOCKED"** to Notes — no AI skills may be run on this ticket

#### Attention Required

If tickets match BOTH: **Waiting > 24h** AND **10+ replies** → show:

```
### Attention Required - Stale & High-Touch Tickets

| Ticket | Subject | Status | Customer | Replies | Waiting Since |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|---------------|
```

Skip if none match.

#### Action Items

1. **Needs Response** - New/Open tickets waiting for agent reply
2. **SLA Risk** - Critical or high-priority tickets with stale updates
3. **Pending Bump** - Pending tickets that may need customer follow-up
4. **High-Touch Stale** - 10+ replies AND waiting > 24h

#### Quick Actions

After reviewing the pool, the user can take action on specific tickets:

- **Investigate a ticket:** "investigate ticket #XYZ" — creates a full case in `cases/ZD-{id}/` with investigation notes, customer response draft, and metadata viewable on the TSE Hub dashboard
- **Classify a ticket:** "classify ticket #XYZ" — determines the ticket type (bug, question, feature request, etc.) and saves to `meta.json`
- **Download attachments:** "download attachments from #XYZ" — downloads flares, logs, screenshots to `cases/ZD-{id}/assets/`

### Deep Dive

If asked about a specific ticket, use `.cursor/skills/_shared/zd-api.sh read {TICKET_ID}` (or Glean fallback).

## Filtering

Modify the search query:
- By status: `status:open`, `status:pending`, `status:new`
- By priority: `priority:high`, `priority:urgent`
- Combined: `type:ticket assignee:me status:open priority:high`

For Glean fallback, combine filters with `|` in `dynamic_search_result_filters`.
