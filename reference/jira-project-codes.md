## Notes

- Each `Support - {Product}` project is for **escalations** to Engineering
- Feature requests use a different naming: `Support FR - {Product}` (e.g., `FRAPMS` for APM feature requests)
- Some TSE specs may map to multiple JIRA projects depending on the specific issue
- "Misc/New" doesn't have a dedicated project - TSEs should escalate to the most relevant product project
