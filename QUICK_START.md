## Using It

### Start Investigation
Ask Cursor:
> "Investigate Zendesk ticket 12345"

Cursor will:
1. ✅ Fetch ticket from Zendesk
2. ✅ Check if similar cases exist
3. ✅ Search for known issues
4. ✅ Create investigation folder
5. ✅ Generate notes template

### During Investigation
- **Drop files** into `cases/ZD-12345/assets/`
- **Ask Cursor** to search Confluence, GitHub, or historical cases
- **Document findings** in `notes.md`
- **Use templates** from `templates/` for customer communication

### Need to Escalate?
Ask Cursor:
> "Create JIRA escalation for ZD-12345"

Cursor will help you create a properly formatted SCRS ticket.

### Resolved the Issue?
```bash
# Archive the case
python3 scripts/zendesk_client.py archive 12345
```

python3 scripts/jira_client.py search "project = SCRS AND status = Open"

# Get escalation details
python3 scripts/jira_client.py get SCRS-1234
```

### Using Cursor AI
```
"Investigate Zendesk ticket 12345"
"Search historical cases for [issue description]"
"What are common causes of [problem]?"
"Create JIRA escalation for ZD-12345"
"Search Confluence for [topic]"
"Show me similar cases from the archive"
```

---

## Example Workflow

### 1. New Ticket Arrives
```
Customer: "Logs not appearing in Datadog"
```

### 2. Start Investigation
**Ask Cursor:**
> "Investigate Zendesk ticket 54321"

**Cursor creates:**
- `cases/ZD-54321/` folder
- `README.md` with metadata
- `notes.md` for documentation

### 3. Research
**Ask Cursor:**
> "Search for similar cases about missing logs"

**Cursor searches:**
- Historical archive cases
- Confluence documentation
- Known issues list
- Related JIRA tickets

### 4. Troubleshoot
- Request agent logs from customer
- Save to `cases/ZD-54321/assets/logs/`
- Test hypotheses, document in `notes.md`
- Use Cursor to search for specific error messages

### 5. Solution Found
- Apply fix with customer
- Document in `notes.md`
- Use template: `templates/customer-communication/solution.md`
- Archive case: `python3 scripts/zendesk_client.py archive 54321`

### 6. (Or) Need to Escalate
**If stuck after 2 days:**
> "Create JIRA escalation for ZD-54321"

**Cursor helps format:**
- All investigation details
- What's been tried
- Evidence collected
- Customer impact

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do
- Document as you investigate (easier than doing it later)
- Use templates for customer communication (consistent, professional)
- Search archive before starting investigation (someone may have solved this)
- Ask Cursor for help searching (it's faster than manual)
- Escalate when appropriate (don't waste days on engineering-level issues)

### ❌ Don't
- Commit customer data to git (it's all gitignored for safety)
- Skip the investigation workflow (documentation helps future cases)
- Be afraid to escalate (it's the right process)
- Give production config advice without considering risks
- Forget to update `solutions/known-issues.md` when you find bugs

## Troubleshooting

**Cursor not recognizing Zendesk commands?**
→ Check [SETUP.md](SETUP.md#troubleshooting), verify MCP config, restart Cursor

**Can't fetch tickets?**
→ Verify API tokens in `.env` and `.cursor/mcp.json`

**Scripts not working?**
→ Check Python 3.8+ installed: `python3 --version`

**MCP errors?**
→ Check Cursor's MCP panel (bottom right) for specific error messages
